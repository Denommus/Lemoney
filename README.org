* How to run this project

** Setup Ruby 2.5.0

   I recommend using [[https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv][rbenv]] for that, the project already includes a
   file to work with it

** Install the dependencies

   Run ~bin/bundle install~ to get all of the bundle dependencies

** Run the migrations

   Run ~bin/rake db:migrate~ to create the database

** Add the ~compute_states~ rake task to a scheduler

   For instance, add an entry for it in the crontab by doing ~crontab
   -u youruser -e~.

   If you're uploading it to Heroku, use its [[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler][scheduler]].

** Run the server

   Now you can run the project with ~bin/rails s~. To add offers, use
   the URL [[http://localhost:3000/offers]].

** Live version

   There's a live version running in [[https://yuri-lemoney.heroku.com]]
